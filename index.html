           The Bell Rock lighthouse is one described as one of the greatest civil engineering achievements. Its design took inspiration from the Eddystone lighthouse in South of England by John Smeaton. Its shape took inspiration from an oak tree which was wide and base and then slowly narrowed . Robert Stevenson, decided to use Smeaton’s design as a base, considering that the Bell rock was in exceptionally harsh conditions and that Smeaton’s design was a huge success.

           The Bell rock, which the lighthouse was supposed to warn off, guarded the approach to the Firth to Forth hiding beneath the waves for the majority of the time and it claimed any ship that came upon it, creating the rocks deadly reputation. This meant during a storm, ships would face the choice of either braving the open sea or risking an approach to the Firth of Forth. A lighthouse was crucial, but there were many factors that stood in the way: Firstly, the location of the rock, which was several kilometres of the east coast of Scotland which created a number of problems, including severe weather exposure, logistics and worker management and structural design challenges. That last was the most significant as in Britian, there were very few offshore lighthouses and the rock itself was an issue as its uneven surface was visible briefly for a few hours at low tide before going back to being submerged under a few feet of water.

           Stevenson’s initial design was a pillar-based lighthouse but upon visiting and rock itself, that design would not work due to the swell around the rock. The next design was based of the Eddystone Lighthouse, the only existing offshore tower at the time. Its designer, John Smeaton, modelled the shape of the lighthouse on an oak tree, He did this based on that ‘we seldom hear of a mature oak tree being uprooted’. Since this was a proven success, Stevenson made his design in line with Smeaton’s. This was very safe as very few lighthouses are ever built offshore, so it’s better to stick with design that were proven effective, instead of experimenting, when faced with such an overwhelming force of nature. But adjustments had to be made: the Eddystone lighthouse was above sea level, but the Bell rock could be submerged up to sixteen feet in water, meaning that it had to be taller, and therefore wider at base and have longer foundations. After his first visit to the Bell Rock, in the year 1800, Stevenson made a variety of drawings, and constructed new models for a building of stone, shewing various methods of connecting the stones, by dovetailing them laterally, like those of the Eddystone lighthouse, and also course to course into one another perpendicularly. At the rock itself, there was about 250 by 130 feet of tough sandstone at low tide, perfect for building a lighthouse on. Finally, Stevenson envisaged a tower that stood over 100 feet tall, 42 feet wide at base and 2 feet embedded in the rock constructed out of stone interlocked in a sturdy dovetail pattern.

           The construction work began in 1807, delayed by a lack of funds: Stevenson calculated that the lighthouse would cost about £42,000 (which is around £2 million in today’s money), which would require an Act of Parliament to allow the Lighthouse board to borrow money. The first step was handling logistics and provide adequate living conditions for the workers. For this purpose, 2 ships, were acquired. The Smeaton, for bringing in supplies from shore and the Pharos to serve as temporary accommodation for the workers before the beacon was completed. Said beacon had to be completed before the work on the lighthouse was started so that the workers can have a comfortable accommodation, and to provide a temporary light for the ships out at sea. The iron beam design was surprisingly resistant to the sea and was the first major success on the rock. The next step was building the foundations for the lighthouse itself. The foundations required fifty-four holes, each measuring two inches in diameter, and eighteen inches in depth. This task used a chisel and hammer where three men were attached to each jumper or chisel; one placed himself in a sitting posture, to guide the instrument and give it a turn at each blow of the hammer; he also sponged or cleaned out the hole, and supplied it occasionally with a little water; while the other two, with hammers of sixteen pounds weight, struck the jumper alternately, generally bringing the hammer with a swing round the shoulder. The three men relieved each other in the operation of guiding the jumper and striking with the hammers. No modern machinery, just the power of one’s arm. For the tower to rise above the foundations, a crane was needed the chief difficulties attending the application of the common crane in such a situation, consisted in the laying the stones perpendicularly into their respective places, as they were all a dove-tail or angular form. Instead, a moveable beam to work upon a bolt at the foot or lower end of the upright shaft, instead of a fixed beam at the top of the system. Another difficulty was moving the stones from the ships around the rock. To resolve this, the decision to lay cast-iron railways round the site of the Lighthouse, projecting to the several landing-places, was made, on which waggons could easily be wheeled in all directions. The beacon, cranes, railway and ships all allowed the tower to rise in a timely manner. Over the next years, work included building a rope bridge that connected the lighthouse to the beacon and new taller balance cranes specially designed for the Bell rock. By 1810, the last stones were being fitted and the lightroom was constructed. Stevenson chose a unique signal with a red and white reflector light and additional fog bells to warn ships. On 1 February 1811, the lighthouse was officially finished, and it ended the death toll of the Bell rock, making the passage safe.
